# loconet-routectrl3

Route controller for a loconet-enabled model railroad.

This project is made with Microchip Studio (formerly Atmel Studio). It does **not** work with Arduino.
The code is tested on a [AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM164151),
but it should work on the entire AVR DA family, and possibly the AVR DB family too.

Yes, I know. Documentation is non-existent right now. Work is in progress.
I have to make the repo public before I can enable the wiki pages.

### Note
This repository uses submodules. Add **--recurse-submodules** when cloning the project:

***git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ejbergdk/loconet-routectrl3.git***

Alternatively, run ***git submodule update --init --recursive*** after cloning.
